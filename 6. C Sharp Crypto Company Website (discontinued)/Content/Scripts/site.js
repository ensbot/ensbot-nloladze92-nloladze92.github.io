From lending in the internal community and giving away non-repayable loans to raise one’s Marks, to large international projects such as a base on the Moon. Groupings of tokens can be made to define territories and overcome regulatory hurdles, such as lending in the state of Texas as the predominant auto-lender in Ohni with 30 million Tokens. However, outside of regional contexts, there will be tiny communal loans, zip code loans, state loans, national loans and international loans. Some areas and even states may be occupied by other lenders which bar competition.<br/><br/> Outside of the regional territories, such as National or International Loans, anyone can lend to these projects. As tiny communities and larger cities become more energy efficient, the Zeus network (a name for all GPUs across the globe processing Ohni) gets stronger and the Ohni AI goes online, Ohni goes into full gear. Larger multi-national projects such as deep-sea colonies, smart robots, integrated cities, hyperloops, moon bases and even colonizing Mars may be plausible. By defining your region or territory and lending non-repayable interest-free loans, any community can finally get a leg up and begin to improve itself and become self-sufficient over time. <br /><br /> As the smaller parts of the Ohni Economy get stronger, so will the larger parts. All loans by their nature are interest free, to prevent people becoming burdened by interest. To add to that, social scores called Volk are tied into the creditability of people to receive loans, everything from; mortgages, auto loans, maternity leave, vacations, schooling, college and businesses can be lent for in Ohni, with time. This prevents people abusing the system as they can be ostracized. Volk or social scores are improved by timely repayment of loans, community service, militia and military service, educating others, following community values, donating to charities and being reliably employed. The entire system is also balanced out by Marks, which rate Token Holders for trust and reliability. So one end, people are measured the good they do to the community while Token Holders are measured by the good they do to the people.";

Therefore Ohni currency will be balanced by utilizing \"slim blockchains\" or self-editing, off-chain, localized, IOT mobile blockchains. These self-editing blockchains push data, from phone to phone until the network has accepted the specific transaction history, and then proceeds to unload older transactions onto a miner. Once a miner verifies that the spending used to earn Ohni is authentic and that the Ohni was created legitimately, it can then process the buying and selling of that Ohni on the international market through the Zeus Machine (again, just a series of miners around the globe who buy and sell Ohni . <br/><br /> Older data is recycled onto the Ohni Cloud, where it is then processed and worked on by corporate GPUs for the purpose of dissecting data and finding patterns in spending. This is then visualized published through Janus which is a publically accessible form (to be made by 2025) for viewing spending and corporations buying demand. This process is like a factory for data, the data only resides as much as it needs to, where it’s needed. In the moment of creation of an Ohni, with a consumer transaction, it is immediately passed onto phones who verify the spending. The data resides on that Ohni, that is to say, when you go and buy something, that data resides on the Ohni you received as a cashback. <br /> <br /> Then that data is encrypted and passed around on mobile devices which verify the transaction.This may be several thousand devices locally, so the transaction is still \“fresh\” if you will.Then once enough devices can confirm the spending, the transaction is parsed onto a miner.The miner will decrypt the data, run centralized algorithms to detect the user and verify trust, verify the transactions were authentic and then send out their stamp of approval by pinging devices. In turn, all of these mobile devices receive a small amount of Ohni for helping to \“mine the network.\” <br /><br/> As approval of the Ohni is sent out, devices around the network receive their small share of Ohni and then delete the data associated with that Ohni. So now, the Ohni remains for whoever has it, but it is now just an empty currency. Meanwhile, the data associated with that transaction is once again encrypted, and then sent to the Ohni Cloud where it is decrypted, inspected and then added to a database based on the location of that purchase and cashback of Ohni. This means that data is smoothly processed and Ohni currency remains as it is on the individual users' phone to be used for payments of anything. <br/> <br/> This new and innovative idea of \"slim blockchains\" allows for incredible speeds, as no centralized database has to be pinged, only local mobile devices. It also allows for transactions to go through, separating the signature from the transaction and allowing for lightening speeds. Confirmation can be done in real time and then re-confirmed by the miner several days later as the old data is recycled off the network which allows new transactions and data to be imported to the mobile \"minging\" devices. This keeps the IOT blockchains “slim” and lightning fast which makes for easier adoption.";

The way the localized IOT blockchains will be connected is through the Zeus Machine, which will be a series of worldwide miners that will do spot trading of Ohni currency exchanging it for fiats all over the world. This process would work exactly like a torrent, pinging other miners about how much Ohni and fiat they currently hold to instantly process payments across the world. Perhaps, a local miner wouldn’t be able to sell millions of dollars in Ohni instantly, but miners across the globe could. By distributing network load across the globe with the decentralized Zeus Machine and through a series of IOT blockchains, even the smallest of towns could participate in the global economy. <br /> <br />Furthermore, this massive series of GPUs (which is nicknamed the \"Zeus Machine\") also acts as a safeguard, running machine learning algorithms that are pushed from the Ohni Cloud. The Zeus Machine would run various algorithms from detecting fraud, searching for malware and executing actions to maintain the network automatically and instantly. The larger this network gets, the faster it gets, with the specific miner tokens verifying miners instantly so that the miners can process Ohni currency as authentic quickly and allowing a streamlined pipeline of data to eventually, the Ohni Cloud. <br /> <br/> The Zeus Machine would connect the globe by certifying votes through Ohni Token IDs thus verifying identities and thus allowing a decentralized financial system. Ohni will work because of the localized blockchains, which would allow micro-payment transactions in the millions per second, granting Ohni currency (which is not the Ohni Token) in the form of cashback to \"mobile\" miners. All these GPU miners on the cryptocurrency network could easily be the infrastructure behind the Ohni Network. Individuals of any variety can participate and get awarded Ohni Mining Tokens to set up their infrastructure and together with the Consumer Lending Tokens, will be able to modify their localized blockchains as well. Miners will work with token holders to also help execute code and actions that token holders choose to utilize (for modifying the local IOT blockchain). With the Zeus Machine, instead of installing towers and launching satellites, all that has to be done is to offer miners lucrative amounts of Ohni currency and instantly, the world’s largest and most intense computer infrastructure is connected with Ohni.";

Consumers will use the data through the open-ended API known as Janus, to pledge their spending for renovations at businesses they shop at. In exchange the business renovates and donates fiat to the local Ohni Community Pool, from which community improvements and volunteers can be hired. It is the Ohni Token Holder that approves of the injection of fiat into the Local Consumer Pool and then backs the pledged spending to the business by lending Ohni currency to it. This cycle allows consumers to be given Ohni currency in the form of cashback for their consumers transactions to actually see, who pledged and is spending at said business. <br/> <br/> But as Ohni is being passed around on the IOT blockchain and as it is sent out to the Ohni Cloud, inside the data will be passed around a variety of colors representing products: black for petroleum, green for produce or food, yellow for clothing and etc with the deeper the hue of color for how much was spent. This will allow for a real time local map of spending outside the Janus Platform and would be particularly valuable to a business owner. This would allow anyone to track spending across a city and see previous spending as well through a simple map on the Ohni App. By offering Ohni cashback, businesses can compete for rewards to consumers and consumers can decide which business to shop at. <br/> <br/> Lastly and this is purely theoretical and probably beyond cognition, but if computer processing power increases, it may be plausible to create a language that humans and computers understand. The only way this would be possible would be with images. So with the Ohni Card connected to the Ohni App and Ohni Products being bought, data can be passed on for what a consumer bought in the form of images and computers could read that by understanding what each product is from the marketplace and people could at the same time as well. Again, this is closer to the realm of fiction. <br /> <br /> But, a new Mercedes of a particular model or various forms of fruit juice could be rendered by computers as a whole data point, similiar to a string of binary. This of course would vastly slow down the network and would not be plausible for decades. Furthermore, a computer would convert that image into binary as well so it would mostly be used for quicker human cognition but if speeds of the network could be increased and processing power on devices was to increase, it may be possible to have data to be read by both computers and humans. <br /> <br /> The ideal database would feature all Ohni Products, that could be scanned by consumers and having those products backed up by numbers that were bought and sold within an Ohni Token region. These would all translate to colors in a heat-density map readable to both man and machine. Of course a computer processes all data into binary regardless and has neither opinions on the matter, but this may just be a notion which Ohni will have to research and develop into since Ohni is prime to be the largest shareholder of the new oil, data.";

The front-end must be developed and it will take some time for blockchain technology to reach its critical mass, but with the Ohni Token as a source of identification on a spending network, it is plausible to create a smart economy for the first time. <br /> <br />Ohni will be the first real Artificial Intelligence (AI) in that it will be the first cryptocurrency that tracks consumer spending. Besides utilizing fraud detection through machine learning from GPUs that process Ohni, there will be a backend that will be done at Ohni Corporation. This backend will aim to gauge where demand is going, where the cashback for Ohni is going and what people are buying. If estimations can be made for what people are buying then it could also be estimated what resources are used for products and services that are bought. Then, an AI could see gaps in resource constraints and where demand and consumer spending should be shifting to make the economy more efficient. <br /> <br />  Coal usage, lumber, petroleum products, plastics, cloth, aluminum, various metals, human labor and other resources could be estimated at a rate of consumption and how and where a city should begin to save. It will take significant time and an incredible code base, with thousands of programmers working day and night, but the Ohni AI could take off sometime in the late 2020s.

A smart IOT inter-connected city being guided by an Ohni AI would radically bring efficiency for high standards of living. <br /><br /> Ohni will be the first AI Company in the age of automation and will be at the forefront of all other competitors with its own financial ecosystem, giving rich data that will allow reinforcement learning at faster and faster rates. As long as consumers utilize the app and receive Ohni in the form of cashback, spending transactions will be uploaded to a localized blockchain until they are ready for storage in the Ohni Cloud at which they are transferred over. Then, industrially sized GPU clusters can begin to work and process the data through algorithms.The end result will be the Janus platform, which will show demand, spending, lending and all economic activity in real - time by the 2030s (2025 at the earliest).";

Additionally, Ohni Tokens will have levels of verification, meaning that to know someone is 21 or older to buy alcohol in the United States, they don’t have to show their ID, the Ohni Token already can verify for them. <br/> <br /> This form of identification on the Ohni Token will allow mortgage approvals, car loans and other forms of credit to be checked without peering into the details of someone’s records and having it left on other databases. This can also apply to criminal records where merely a color is returned signaling a positive string of criminal records or not on a person’s token. To access information with the Ohni Token, one has to have a verified Ohni Token for the purpose of access, whether this is an intelligence agency or a police bureau, which also adds transparency since the Ohni Token Holder will know their information has been accessed and the general public network will know an agency has as well.
