The Node Blockchain is a complete blockchain; with a wallet, balance and even a transaction pool.

The Python blockchain is a simpler blockchain with a nominal token layer over it. It also features a .sol script.

The C sharp project is just a simple ASP.net website.

The LAMP stack took me two years and was how I learned programming. Just a combination of MySQL, PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
