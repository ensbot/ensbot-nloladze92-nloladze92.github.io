The C sharp project was for a blockchain business. 
I ran it on C sharp with the intention of the site acting as the real processor
for data coming from a mobile application. Bad idea. Learned a lot of styling and
some stuff about routing.

The LAMP stack took me two years and I did on my own time. I learned all
the basis of web development through it as well as caching and styling by hand.
Used PHP to pass session variables from page to page as well.

The blockchain project will have additional links  below, it actually marketed
and became quite a big thing in the Philippians and online for about three weeks.
To this day it is still widely regarded by many to be the creator of the airdrop in that space.
