<p><em>This is a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> clone where people donate ethereum instead of money. People donate to a decentralized contract on the Ethereum network and then the contract makes requests for spending ether from the contract. All requests must have a majority of contributors approve the request. All transactions are handled through <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>, so you must have that installed.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Contract ABI</strong> is our local implementation of a contract done on the remix tester. That contract must be created through a local running instance of Ethereum known as <strong>Ganache CLI</strong>  which connects through a provider, in this case <strong>Infuria</strong> to create the Ethereum contract from the local instance by using <strong>Truffle</strong>.</p>
<p>After that, finally we can use <strong>MetaMask</strong> as our portal to connect to our server‚Äôs portal, <strong>Web3</strong> to connect to Ethereum. This allows for direct interaction with the ethereum network through our <strong>React Front-End</strong> website. Through a browser, we can directly store, pull and add information to the <strong>Ethereum</strong> network.</p>

<h2 id="to-setup">To Setup:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clone the repo <a href="https://github.com/nloladze92/Kickstarter">here</a> or alternatively zip the repo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CD into directory, on mac use the Terminal application and check the directory with the <code>ls</code> command. On Windows use the Command Prompt (CMD) and check the current directory with <code>dir</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once inside the root Kickstarter folder on the selected Bash application, install the necessary dependencies by running <code>npm install</code>. You will need <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">NPM</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the program afterwards by typing <code>npm run dev</code> in the command line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to localhost 3000 (<a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>) in your local browser. The project will render there by utilizing a node http server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must have <a href="https://metamask.io/"><code>MetaMask</code></a> installed or interacting with the application will not work. All interactions with the contract are done through MetaMask. MetaMask is simply a chrome extension for interacting and executing transactions on the Ethereum network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During all prompts, you should see a MetaMask window open up. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll need to make sure you openly connected to your MetaMask account, that it is running and you may have to hard restart the page with (ctrl-r). You may have to hard refresh at several pages to either see changes or reset in case a transaction didn‚Äôt go through on the blockchain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6Pq6Z6R/3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>You will have to select the <code>Rinkeby Test Network</code> and you will need some ‚Äútest‚Äù ether. You can get test ether from a faucet, such as <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">faucet.rinkeby.io</a> or <a href="http://rinkeby-faucet.com/">rinkeby-faucet.com</a> if you don‚Äôt want to share social media to get test ether.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create <code>Campaign</code>, add the minimum amount someone must donate in <a href="https://bit.ly/2VsrDUs">Wei</a> to join the campaign</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should be returned to the homepage. View your contract from the dropdown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now contribute to this contract in ether, it will update to show contributions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can view requests by clicking the button ‚ÄúView Requests‚Äù in the bottom hand corner of the campaign view. There you‚Äôll be able to add requests as the owner of this campaign (and technically contract üòÉ)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Recipients are who the ether goes to, theoretically this would be a vendor of sorts to prevent the money or ether actually touching hands of the contract owner. This would mean that whoever would make a kickstart campaign wouldn‚Äôt ever actually touch the money ideally. A recipient must be a valid ethereum network address to receive the ether.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once a request is added, any contributor can approve and if more than 50% of contributors approve, the request can be approved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>The same person can contribute more than once but their vote only counts as one approval, this is a known error</code></p>

<p><em>This is a full-scale blockchain implementation. The only difference between this and Bitcoin is the proof-of-work protocol and the automatic calls to mine and replace chains by the longest one. There are also minor security issues but for the most part, this is as complete as a blockchain can be. Of course, there are no miner fees but there is a currency. In order to make POST and GET requests (calls essentially) to the P2P network, you‚Äôll need to have <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>,  installed.</em></p>

<p>The application should be listening for peers on Port 5000. Now here comes the tricky part‚Ä¶ we need other peers to listen and interact with on the blockchain. So open up one  other Bash terminal (whatever you used to run npm run dev with).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If on a mac execute the following command.</p>

<ul>
<li>Let‚Äôs start by checking a public wallet address. Open up the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"><code>Postman</code></a> app and run a get request <code>localhost:3002/public-key</code> then click send.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1v6mY3n/6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<ul>
<li>You should receive a 64 string of characters, this is a SHA256 hash and represents peer 3002‚Äôs ‚Äúaddress‚Äù on the blockchain or the second Bash server instance we have running. You can check 3001‚Äôs public key as well if you‚Äôd like.</li>
<li>Copy that string of characters, open up a second tab in Postman. Change the request in the dropdown from <code>GET</code> to <code>POST</code>. When you copy the string of characters, you‚Äôll have to make sure the ‚Äú‚Äù double quotes are around the characters.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In the second tab, we‚Äôll get the first client, PORT  3000 to send to PORT 3001 transactions of 50 tokens</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9NrPKd9/9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Then in the second tab, type <code>localhost:3001/transact</code> and click the body tag, then click <code>raw</code> since we need to pass variables to the transaction, then in the right-hand drop down menu, click <code>JSON (application/json)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You‚Äôre  going to need to paste raw JSON into the body, we‚Äôll sound 50 tokens initially (since all starting wallets come with 500 tokens). Make sure that the word recipient and amount and the port‚Äôs public key are all encased ‚Äú‚Äù double strings since they are strings and the amount we are sending is a number, so it does not need to be encased in strings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class=" language-sh"><code class="prism  language-sh">{
	"recipient": "the 3002's port public key (address) that you copied
	is pasted here",
	"amount": 50
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Click send a few times, you should get an output array confirming the original wallet dropping in amounts of 50 tokens with those tokens being sent to the address you specified. Meaning, that hey, we just sent tokens through a blockchain! üôå</li>
<li>We can easily test if the transactions have been put in the following block to be mined by running a <code>GET</code> request <code>localhost:3002/transactions</code> in a separate tab or <code>localhost:3001/transactions</code> respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3CvbYfM/10.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs time to send those transactions in a block ‚úâÔ∏è. Let‚Äôs mine a block in either one of the Postman tabs or another one, a <code>GET</code> request <code>localhost:3001/mine-transactions</code> or 3002 respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can hit the send button several times for the mine-transactions command, the mining reward is 50 tokens and shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can check our wallet balance by conducting another transaction by running our old <code>localhost:3001/transact</code> with the JSON specifying the recipient and amount. You will see that indeed the miner reward does apply to whatever port actually mines the transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>There is no native check wallet balance function unfortunately.</code></p>

<li>Clone the repo <a href="https://github.com/nloladze92/Python-Simple-Blockchain">here</a> or alternatively zip the repo.</li>
<li>Make sure you have <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a> installed, that is where we‚Äôll run our python script.</li>
<li>Open the Anaconda application (might be known as Anaconda Navigator). Launch Spyder from the home menu, this will take you to a separate IDE.<br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/jznKfLh/11.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></li>
<li>With the Spyder application, open (Ctrl-o) the following files; port5001, port 5002, port 5003, nodes.json and transaction.json.</li>
<li>You‚Äôll want to run Port 5001, 5002 and 5003. All three files. To do so you can hit the run (F5) key up top (green arrow) <img src="https://i.ibb.co/QpB4Hx9/15.jpg" alt="enter image description here">. You‚Äôll need an Ipython console open, which is under, consoles &gt; open an Ipython console (Ctrl-t). You‚Äôll need a <strong>separate</strong> instance of each Ipython console running a separate instance of a Port. So, we‚Äôre running three ports, we‚Äôll need three Ipython consoles running each file separately.</li>

<ul>
<li>Open up the <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> app. Exit out of the immediate screen prompt. Then open up three separate tabs. If you get any weird responses, remember to close out of the tab and open up a new one to refresh the cache.</li>
<li>In each tab, as a <code>GET</code> request, type in <code>http://127.0.0.1:5001/get_chain</code> and like so for port 5002 and port 5003. Meaning‚Ä¶<br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/XFZXJkR/13.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We now have three separate instance of a blockchain having the initial generated block being displayed</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Let‚Äôs run further tests. In all three Postman tabs, select <code>POST</code> and replace the app request<code>get_chain</code> part with <code>connect_node</code>. Then, in the nodes.json file, we‚Äôll want to copy everything there and in Postman, under our request click <code>body</code> and then select the <code>raw</code> option and select <code>JSON (application/json)</code>. Whatever node instance you are currently running in the Postman tab, you‚Äôll want to delete since you can‚Äôt connect to your own node‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre already connected to it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/tsNx4xV/16.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<ul>
<li>Let‚Äôs mine a block now that all three of our nodes are connected. It will have to be a <code>GET</code> request so switch that from a <code>POST</code> to a <code>GET</code> request. Then type in <code>http://127.0.0.1:5001/mine_block</code> or replace the 5001 with whatever node you want to mine on. Remember, it has to be a <code>GET</code> request. Then click send and you should see a block being mined with an index. You can mine as much as you want.</li>
<li>Now navigate to any other tab and input <code>http://127.0.0.1:5001/replace_chain</code>. This should also be a <code>GET</code> request. You‚Äôll now see the blocks on the new port have been replaced or in other words, the blockchain has been replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5jpKQX0/17.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<ul>
<li>Now let‚Äôs send a transaction. In the Spyder application, copy what‚Äôs inside the transaction.json file‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
<pre class=" language-sh"><code class="prism  language-sh">{
    "sender": "Person 2",
    "receiver": "Person 3",
    "amount": 10000 
}
</code></pre>
<p>And going back to Postman, in one of the tabs run the <code>add_transaction</code> command as <code>Post</code> variable. Click on <code>body</code> and select <code>raw</code> and then <code>JSON (application/json)</code>. The command that is about to be sent should be <code>http://127.0.0.1:5002/add_transaction</code> or from whatever port you want it to be sent from. Click send. You should get a response along the lines of <code>"message": "This transaction will be added to Block 8"</code>.<br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/JCyRJ6Y/18.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, you must mine a block from that port. So if you added a transaction on port 5003, you must mine a block on port 5003 via a <code>GET</code> request like so‚Ä¶ <code>http://127.0.0.1:5003/mine_block</code>. This will send the add_transaction <code>POST</code> request we had inputted.</li>
<li>Now that, that block has been mined. Replace the chains on the other tabs. Now, we have successfully inputted a transaction, had it passed in our block and mined blocks and had chains become replaced.</li>

Then that plan could be uploaded and voted on. Mind you, this was before React so the site was a mind-bender in design and not in the good way.
