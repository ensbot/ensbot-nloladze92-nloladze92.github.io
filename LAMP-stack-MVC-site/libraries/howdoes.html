Pick a local business and type it's name in. The business will be availble if it's on google search and
you're picking something from where you are browsing from.

<br />
<br />

The next step is to measure the squarefeet around a business and the space it occupies. Click around the building,
making sure to overextend past it's boundries a little. While not compleatly accurate, the measurement will be within
10% to 30% accurate and enough to estimate costs for the plan.

Next, input what kind of business this is. The only available options there are right now are coffee shops, grocery stores
and gas stations.

<br />
<br />

Now, pick the options you want to see at this store. What changes do you want to see? What would make you keep shopping there?
What do you believe the world needs more of? What do you want to see <b>YOUR DOLLAR</b> do?

<br />
<br />

Lastly, how much are you going to spend there per month for the business implementing those options? And, for how many months will
you spend there? The number of people will be displayed who must shop like you pledge to shop for the business to cover it's costs.
Conversio Republic's cut comes out of the businesses' pocket and not yours.
<br />
<br />
As it stands, it'll be another year or so before people can pledge towards plans and rate other plans. But, progress is being made on
the site everyday. Thank you for using Conversio Republic!
